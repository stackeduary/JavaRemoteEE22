1. Data types can be broken down into two categories. What are they? (Hint: one has only eight data types and the other has an unlimited number)
  - primitives
  - reference data types
    - anything that is not a primitive; e.g., objects, arrays, etc.

2. How can you create your own custom data type?
  - create a class (or an interface, or an enum)

3. What are the two types of equality in Java? Write them out in words as well as syntactically.
  - reference equality
    - `==`
  - value equality
    - `object1.equals(object2)`

4. Continuing from the previous question, which one can the developer provide his/her own implementation of?
  - `.equals()`

5. Reference equality implies value equality.
  - if two objects have the same memory reference, then they must have the same value.

6. Everything in Java is an object.

7. The Object class is the root class in Java. Everything inherits from the Object class.
